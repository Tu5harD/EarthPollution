                by causing mild to severe food illnesses or, worse, contributing
                to or causing the development of serious health problems such as
                hormonal and metabolic problems, or even various types of
                cancer. Nervous system problems may also be induced by food
                polluted with certain pesticides. Additionally, in rare cases
                when highly polluted food is consumed, serious food poisoning or
                death may occur almost immediately. Food contamination can
                trigger anything from a small discomfort to life-threatening
                diseases. On average, more than 70 million cases of food-borne
                illnesses occur in the U.S. every year, resulting in
                approximately 5,000 deaths per year!

              <h2>Causes of Food Pollution</h2>
              <p>
                There are numerous causes of food pollution. Basically, any
                pollutant that comes in contact with food has the potential to
                pollute it. Various vegetables may get contaminated with toxic
                bacterial strains (from irrigation water, groundwater, or soil)
                which may only be destroyed by processing the polluted food at
                high temperatures.{" "}
                <a href="/chemical/" title="Chemical pollution">
                  Toxic chemicals can also get into the food in a variety of

              <p>
                The fact that plants (vegetables, crops, or trees) become
                contaminated with pollutants from the environment comes from the
                ability of plants to extract environmental pollutants through
                their roots, along with water and nutrients. In the case of air
                pollutants, those usually enter plants also through roots, after
                being first deposed on the ground with precipitation water. This
                is why some plants (non-edible species) are actually used to
                remediate little to moderately polluted soil by extracting
                pollutants from soils (an innovative remediation called
                phytoremediation).

                <a href="/food/facts/" title="Facts">
                  The sources of food pollution<b> </b>are numerous and hard to

                . They include various chemicals and/or microorganisms that get
                into contact with food during the growing, processing or
                packaging stages. Basically, any existent environmental
                pollutant might get into our food, one way or another. Thus, any
                of the sources polluting the air, water, and soil may also
                become sources of food pollution. Additionally, animal fodder
                contains antibiotics and potentially toxic chemicals that may be
                retained into animals (which later on become human food).

              <p>
                <strong>
                  Food pollution risks depend on a variety of factors,
                  including:
                </strong>

                <li>
                  <strong>Type of pollutant</strong> – while any pollutant
                  present in food may pose a health risk, the{" "}
                  <strong>
                    pollutants that are persistent and bioaccumulative are those
                    that pose the higher risks
                  </strong>{" "}
                  because they may accumulate in food over time resulting in
                  concentrations much higher than in a surrounding environment
                  (e.g., accumulation of persistent chemicals such as
                  organomercurial compounds or PCBs in fish).
                  <strong>Hormones in food</strong> may also pose serious risks
                  that are still uncertain. For example, contamination of cow
                  milk with an artificial hormone (rBGH) used to increase milk
                  production may be linked to some types of cancers in humans.
                  Thus, a safe alternative is to avoid, if possible consumption
                  of food with hormones.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Type of food</strong> – fish are more dangerous than
                  other food due to their potential exposure to a higher variety
                  of contaminants and the accumulation and concentration of
                  certain compounds in fish. Also, any bird or animal consuming
                  polluted fish may become contaminated itself and thus transmit
                  the pollution further through the food chain.

                Pollution from the environment (soil, sediments, water, and air)
                gets into the food web by polluting plants or animals that come
                in contact with environmental pollution. For example,
                <a href="/water/" title="Water pollution ">
                  water pollution
                </a>{" "}
                may accumulate and concentrate in fish. Fish may be consumed by
                birds and other animals and the pollution gets transferred
                through the food chains until it reaches humans. By the time the
                polluted meat or fish reaches humans, the pollution may be
                substantially increased compared to the original concentration.
                Thus, human intoxication cases may be serious.
              </p>
              <h2>Safe Food Alternative</h2>
              <p>
                An alternative that may ensure production of less polluted food
                was recently proposed in Japan. Thus, it was proposed to grow
                vegetables in factories which would eliminate the unpredictable
                effect of environmental pollution, unpredictable weather, or
                pests. The process would be all computerized, controlling
                various factors affecting growth. This safe food alternative is
                proposed by the Ozu Corporation in Tokyo. Would this constitute
                the future of agriculture? Only time will tell… In the meantime,
                we are still dealing with food grown on dirty land subjected to
                various food pollutants, pests, and unpredictable weather!
                <strong>Food pollution risks</strong> are everywhere and all we
                can do is minimize individual exposure to polluted food by
                informing ourselves and taking action.
