              <strong>Water pollution </strong>
              <span>
                is defined as the presence in groundwater of toxic chemicals and
                biological agents that exceed what is naturally found in the
                water and may pose a threat to human health and/or the
                environment. Additionally, water pollution may consist of
                chemicals introduced into the water bodies as a result of
                various human activities. Any amount of those chemicals pollutes
                the water, regardless of the harm they may pose to human health
                and the environment.

              <h2>Causes</h2>
              <p>
                Many of the chlorinated solvents commonly used in industry (such
                as PCE, TCE, 1,1,1-TCA) are examples of such chemicals polluting
                our waters exclusively due to human activities. Another example
                is MTBE (Methyl-tert-butyl-ether), a gasoline oxygenate that is
                currently banned in the U.S. Regardless of their provenance, the
                chemicals or biological agents causing water pollution are
                generically referred to as water pollutants.The chemical and
                biological agents represent the main causes of water pollution
                and are generically referred to as water pollutants. <br />
                Any kind of water can become polluted, regardless of its size or
                location. This includes lakes from remote areas or huge water
                bodies and is due to the air transportation of pollutant
                particles and their transfer into precipitation water. The
                groundwater and surface water consist of swimming pools, ponds,
                lakes, creeks, rivers, seas, and oceans that may all become
                polluted at some point. Due to the quick diffusion and
                dissipation of contamination and the faster natural degradation
                processes, the bigger the water body is, the shorter the time
                required for naturally cleansing the pollution and recovery.

              <h2>Types of Water Pollution</h2>
              <p>
                There are various types of water pollution based on the various
                causes of water pollution. Various classifications can be made,
                based on various water pollution causes:
                <br />
                The type of the water pollutants – based on this classification
                criteria, water pollution can be:

                  Chemical –
                </a>
                when various chemicals are the water pollution causes. The
                following chemicals are the most common water pollutants:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-style">
                <li>
                  <a href="/water/" title="Water pollution">
                    Crude oil and various petroleum products
                  </a>
                  (including gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, motor and
                  lubricating oils, jet fuel). These compounds are lighter than
                  water and thus always sit on top of water forming sheens of
                  “free product”. However, part of these compounds dissolve in
                  water and, even in small amounts may be harmful and at the
                  same time may remain unnoticeable by the eye.

                  </a>
                  (including nitrates and phosphates) – while small amounts are
                  useful to life, higher amounts of nitrates and phosphates in
                  water are only beneficial to algae and harmful microorganisms
                  and are poisonous to human and aquatic life. These
                  contaminants cannot be seen themselves in water (as they do
                  not form sheens or color the water), but their effects can.
                  The typical effect of water pollution by fertilizers (usually
                  through agricultural runoff) is the fast and abundant water
                  growth.

                  which sink in water (are denser than water) and are quite
                  persistent and toxic. These compounds thus, cannot be seen by
                  the eye, in contrast with petroleum products that are easily
                  seen as sheens on top of water surface.

                  with military bases, construction sites (when explosives are
                  used). However, natural formation in arid areas may account
                  for perchlorate in water, too (e.g., in Chile, Texas or
                  California where natural formation of perchlorate has been

                  and discharges. Examples of such compounds are: chloroform,

              <p>
                Water pollution may cause a large variety of diseases and poses
                a serious problem for human health. This is mainly because we
                may get exposed to polluted water in various ways, including,
                but not necessarily limited to:
                <ul className="list-style">
                  <li>Drinking polluted water</li>
                  <li>Bathing or showering in polluted water</li>
                  <li>
                    Breathing the vapors of a polluted water while sitting next
                    to a polluted water source
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Consuming polluted food (meat and/or vegetables) affected by
                    polluted water
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Consuming meat from animals fed with polluted water of food
                    affected by polluted water (e.g. vegetables irrigated with
                    polluted water or grown in an area with polluted
                    groundwater)
                  </li>

              <h2>Diseases</h2>
              <p>
                The effects of water pollution may appear immediately after
                exposure and be more or less violent in the case of drinking
                water with a high amount of pollutants. On the other hand, the
                effects may appear some time after repetitive exposure to water
                contaminated with lower amounts of pollutants. The health
                effects of drinking contaminated water may range from simple
                intoxication and stomach aches to deadly diseases or sudden
                death.
