Such\n                contaminants include metals, inorganic ions and salts (e.g.\n                phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, nitrates), and many organic\n                compounds (such as lipids, proteins, DNA, fatty acids,\n                hydrocarbons, PAHs, alcohols, etc.). These compounds are mainly\n                formed through soil microbial activity and decomposition of\n                organisms (e.g., plants and animals). Additionally, various\n                compounds get into the soil from the atmosphere, for instance\n                with precipitation water, as well as by wind activity or other\n                types of soil disturbances, and from surface water bodies and\n                shallow groundwater flowing through the soil. When the amounts\n                of soil contaminants exceed natural levels (what is naturally\n                present in various soils), pollution is generated.

However, children are usually more susceptible to\n                exposure to contaminants, because they come in close contact\n                with the soil by playing in the ground; combined with lower\n                thresholds for disease, this triggers higher risks than for\n                adults. Therefore, it is always important to test the soil\n                before allowing your kids to play there, especially if you live\n                in a highly industrialized area.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n              </p>\n              <h2>Soil Pollution Facts</h2>\n              <p>\n                Soil acts as a natural sink for contaminants, by accumulating\n                and sometimes concentrating contaminants which end up in soil\n                from various sources. Tiny amounts of contaminants accumulate in\n                the soil and - depending on the environmental conditions\n                (including soil types) and the degradability of the released\n                contaminant - can reach high levels and pollute the soil. If the\n                soil is contaminated, home-grown vegetables and fruits may\n                become polluted too. This happens because most of the soil\n                pollutants present in the soil are extracted by the plants along\n                with water every time they feed. Thus, it is always prudent to\n                test the soil before starting to grow anything edible. This is\n                especially important if your garden is located near an\n                industrial or mining area, or within 1 mile of a main airport,\n                harbor, landfill, or foundry.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Soilcontain;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Navbar from \"./Navbar\";\nimport Hero from \"./Hero\";\nimport Footer from \"./Footer\";\nimport Soilcontain from \"./Soilcontain\";\nconst Soil = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Navbar />\n      <Hero\n        img=\"https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/82/65/61/360_F_182656191_YKF0yj0Hbgo12xw8m9BgDvcHbECRy63M.jpg\"\n        heading=\"Soil Pollution\"\n        title=\"Plant a tree a day and keep soil erosion away.\"\n      />\n      <Soilcontain/>\n      <Footer\n        firstHeading=\"Earth\"\n        lastHeading=\"Pollution\"\n        contact=\"+91 7499833141\"\n        firstLocation=\"32 Shirala\"\n        lastLocation=\"Maharastra, India\"\n        email=\"tushardukane9@gmail.com\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Soil;\n","const Home_item = [\n  {\n    heading: \"Pollution\",\n    title: \"Wipe out pollution before it wipes you out.\",\n    info:\n      \"Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.
